<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The topic of this project is sorting. The goal is two-fold: First, you will
acquire hands-on experience with the implementation of an advanced sorting
algorithm. Second, you will learn how to use sorting to solve a practical
problem efficiently. In the first part, you will implement an enhanced version
of quicksort. In the second part, you will use sorting to solve a real-world
application.

</p><h2>Part 1 - Fast three-way partitioning. (J. Bentley and D. McIlroy)</h2>

<h3>Basic Algorithm</h3>

<p>
You will implement an entropy-optimal sort <code>Quick3wayBM.java</code> based
on keeping equal keys at both the left and right ends of the sub-array
<code>a[lo,...,hi]</code>. Practically, you need to maintain indices that
enforce the following invariants:

</p><ul>
<li>indices <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are such that
<code>a[lo,...,p]</code> and <code>a[q,...,hi]</code> are all equal to
<code>a[lo]</code>
</li><li>an index <code>i</code> is such that <code>a[p+1,...,i-1]</code>
are all less than <code>a[lo]</code>
</li><li>an index <code>j</code> is such that <code>a[j+1,...,q-1]</code>
are all greater than <code>a[lo]</code>
</li></ul>

These notations are illustrated below.

<p>
In your code, you should add to the inner partitioning loop code to swap
<code>a[i]</code> with <code>a[p+1]</code> (and increment <code>p</code>) if
it is equal to <code>v</code>, and to swap <code>a[j]</code> with
<code>a[q-1]</code> (and decrement <code>q</code>) if it is equal to
<code>v</code>, after the usual comparisons of <code>a[i]</code> and
<code>a[j]</code> with <code>v</code>. The partitioning should terminate when
(<code>i</code> &gt; <code>j</code>), and you should treat (<code>i</code>
== <code>j</code>) as a special case where you should just simply advance
<code>j</code> by one and break the loop. After the partitioning loop has
terminated, add code to swap the items with equal keys into position, whereby
you will have to <code>swap(lo, j)</code> and then <code>swap(lo+1, j-1)</code>
... <code>swap(j-k, p)</code>. Similarly you have to do the same for the
elements to the right of <code>j</code>, <code>swap(j+1, hi)</code> ...
<code>swap(j+w, q)</code>, whereby <code>k</code> (resp. <code>w</code>) are
the number of duplicate elements to the left (resp. right) of the sub-array.

</p><h3>Improvements</h3>

<p>
In your code, you must implement the following improvements:

</p><ul>
<li><b>Cutoff to insertion sort.</b> It usually pays off to switch to
insertion sort for tiny arrays. The optimum value of the cutoff in your
code MUST be 8.
</li><li><b>Median-of-three partitioning.</b> A second improvement is to use the
median of a small sample of items taken from the array as the partitioning
item. Doing so will give a slightly better partition, but at the cost of
computing the median. It turns out that most of the available improvement
comes from choosing a sample of size 3 (and then partitioning on the middle
item). You should ONLY use this improvement if the current number of elements
to sort is (â‰¤ 40).
</li><li><b>Tukey ninther.</b> Use the <i>Tukey ninther</i> technique when the previous optimizations do not apply. In the Tukey ninether method, the partitioning element is selected as the median of 3 medians of three. Specifically, if your 9 evenly sampled values are: 
  <em>(v0, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8)</em>, 
   
  compute:<br>
  <ul>
    <li> <em>m0</em> = median(<em>v0, v1, v2</em>) </li>
    <li> <em>m1</em> = median(<em>v3, v4, v5</em>) </li>
    <li> <em>m2</em> = median(<em>v6, v7, v8</em>) </li>
  </ul>
   
  and select median(<em>m0, m1, m2</em>) as your partitioning element.
</li></ul>


<h3>Note: Finding the Median</h3>

<p>
To find the median in Median-of-3 (resp. Tukey ninther) you should pick three
(resp. nine) elements spaced in your sub-array by
<code>floor((N-1)/2)</code> (resp. <code>floor((N-1)/8)</code>) starting from
the first element, where <code>N</code> is the number of elements in the
sub-array. Note that the 3rd (resp. 9th) selected element may not be the last
element.

</p><h3>Input / Output</h3>

<p>
Your program should read the input from <code>StdIn.java</code>. It should
process the input using the following command:

</p><pre>	%java -cp .:stdlib.jar:algs4.jar Quick3wayBM &lt; numbers1.txt
</pre>

<p>
The file contains a list of numbers in the format (&lt;number&gt;&lt;space&gt;).
The first number is the number of elements in the file.

</p><p>
In each recursive sorting call of the array you have to output the following as
a tuple following the exact format shown below. Your program should simply print
the output to the command line. In the case you used the insertion sort just
output:

</p><pre>	(Insertion Sort, &lt;lo&gt;, &lt;hi&gt;)
</pre>

<p>
Otherwise, you should output:

</p><pre>	(&lt;Improvement_used&gt;, &lt;lo&gt;, &lt;v&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, &lt;j&gt;, &lt;q&gt;, &lt;hi&gt;)
</pre>

<p>
where <code>&lt;Improvement_used&gt;</code> will be either "<code>Median of 3</code>"
or "<code>Tukey Ninther</code>", depending on the case.

</p><p>
As an example of the former scenario, your program should output:

</p><pre>	(Insertion Sort, 1, 4)
</pre>

<p>
As two examples of the latter scenario, your program should output:

</p><pre>	(Median of 3, 1, 10, 4, 15, 16, 20, 25)
	(Tukey Ninther, 6, 20, 4, 18, 17, 50, 70)
</pre>

<p>
This output should take place <b>before</b> you move the equal values from the two ends
of the array to the middle.

</p><h3>Step-by-step output</h3>

<p>
In addition to the above output, you will augment your
<code>Quick3wayBM.java</code> code and submit another file that provides
a trace of the sorting steps, called <code>Quick3wayBM_V.java</code>. It should
process the input just as above, with the command:

</p><pre>	%java -cp .:stdlib.jar:algs4.jar Quick3wayBM_V &lt; numbers1.txt
</pre>

<p>
Print to standard output the elements, separated by spaces, in their current
order, with one line per recursive sorting call. The first line should be the
original order of the elements, and the last line should be the sorted order
of the elements. At each step, output the elements <b>after</b> moving the equal
elements in the two ends of the array to the middle.

</p><h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>
Implement the following API. In addition, implement a main function that reads
from the standard input a list of numbers separated by a space. The first number
represents the number of integers to be sorted, followed by those integers.

</p><pre>	public class Quick3wayBM {
	    public static void sort(Comparable[] a) { ... }
	    public static void sort(Comparable[] a, int lo, int hi) {
	        ...
	        // Insertion sort
	        ...
	        // Median of 3
	        ...
	        // Use Tukey ninther as partitioning element
	        ...
	        // Bentley-McIlroy 3-way partitioning
	        ...
	    }
	}
</pre>

<h3>Testing with an example</h3>

<p>
With this document, there are three examples of numbers as a way for you to test
your code and make sure you are following the right format. These files are
<code>numbers1.txt</code>, <code>numbers2.txt</code>, and <code>numbers3.txt</code>,
where each of them provide two different outputs, (<code>output1.txt</code>,
<code>outputV1.txt</code>), (<code>output2.txt</code>, <code>outputV2.txt</code>),
and (<code>output3.txt</code>, <code>outputV3.txt</code>) respectively. You can
find all example files <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs251/projects/project2/examples.tgz">here</a>, or at the top of the page.

</p><h2>Part 2 - Sorting application: Rhyming words</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
For your poetry class, you would like to tabulate a list of rhyming words. For
example, if you had the following words (electrics, ethnic, clinic, coughed,
laughed, metrics), your program should produce the following output:

</p><pre>	[ cli|nic, eth|nic ]
	[ elec|trics, me|trics ]
	[ co|ughed, la|ughed ]
</pre>

<p>
Write a program <code>Rhyming.java</code> that reads in a sequence of words from
standard input and prints them out in the order specified above. Specifically, we
define here rhyming words as a group of words sharing a rhyme, and we define that
rhyme as being the longest possible suffix common to all words in the group. For
instance, in the example above, we do not consider "ic", "ics", or "ed" to be
rhymes because they are suffixes of longer common suffixes.

</p><p>
The output order is defined as follows.

</p><ul>
<li>Words are listed in increasing order of suffix length
</li><li>Among suffixes of the same length, words are listed in alphabetical suffix order
</li><li>Words with common suffix (rhyming words) are listed in alphabetical order
</li></ul>

<p>
Looking back at the previous example: the suffixes are <b>nic</b> (length=3),
<b>trics</b> (length=5), and <b>ughed</b> (length=5). They appear in that order as
a result of rule 1 (length 3 before length 5) and rule 2 (<b>trics</b> comes before
<b>ughed</b> alphabetically). Finally, each set of rhyming words are listed
alphabetically (rule 3). In addition, groups of rhyming words are separated by a
newline. Note that the same word can rhyme with different groups of words. For
instance: (friendly, lucky, murky, rapidly) would lead to the following output:

</p><pre>	[ friendl|y, luck|y, murk|y, rapidl|y ]
	[ luc|ky, mur|ky ]
	[ frien|dly, rapi|dly ]
</pre>

<p>
Again, while "y" is not a rhyme for the group (lucky, murky) (it is a suffix
of the actual rhyme "ky"), it is a rhyme for the group (friendly, lucky, murky,
rapidly), as it is the longest common suffix.

</p><h3>Input / Output</h3>

<p>
Your program should read from standard input, using <code>StdIn.java</code>. It
should process the input using the following command line:

</p><pre>	%java -cp .:stdlib.jar:algs4.jar Rhyming &lt; list1.txt
</pre>

<p>
The file contains a list of strings, one string per line. Your program should
output to standard output all the words sorted as the example stated above. To
facilitate the visual assessment of your result, start each new line (corresponding
to a series of rhyming words in alphabetical order) with an opening square bracket
followed by a space character and, symmetrically, terminate each new line with a
space character followed by a closing square bracket. In addition, each word should
contain a pipe symbol ("|") that indicates the beginning of the identified suffix.
Again, refer to the examples above and to the solution files provided below.

</p><h3>Testing with an example</h3>

<p>
Three test files are available with corresponding solutions. Use them to verify that
your code complies with all the guidelines listed above: <code>list1.txt</code>,
<code>list2.txt</code>, and <code>list3.txt</code>, with <code>loutput1.txt</code>,
<code>loutput2.txt</code>, and <code>loutput3.txt</code>, respectively. You can find
all example files <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs251/projects/project2/examples.tgz">here</a>, or at the top of the page.
