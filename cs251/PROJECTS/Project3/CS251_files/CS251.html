<h2>Project Outline</h2>
<p>
The input consists of a set <code>S</code> of <code>N</code>
two-dimensional records of integers,
each of which consists of a pair of coordinates <code>(x[i],y[i])</code>
for <code>0 ≤ i ≤ N-1</code>, where the <code>x[i]</code> are distinct
(i.e., no two are equal) and the <code>y[i]</code> are also distinct.

</p><p>
Intuitively, the x coordinates represent one desirable attribute of each
record, whereas the y coordinates represent another (different) desirable
attribute of the record.

</p><h2>Part 1</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
Write a program that eliminates from <code>S</code> every record
<code>(x[i],y[i])</code> for which
there exists another record <code>(x[j],y[j])</code> having both
<code>x[j] &gt; x[i]</code> and <code>y[j] &gt; y[i]</code>.

</p><p>
Intuitively, we want to eliminate all records that are doubly inferior to
at least one other record, where "doubly" means in terms of both x coordinate
and in terms of y coordinate.

</p><p>
Output the surviving ("filtered") records in <code>S</code> sorted according
to increasing order of their x coordinates.

</p><p>
Note: You are allowed to use existing sorts (no need to write your own).

</p><h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
Create a class <code>Filter.java</code> to perform the task described above.
Your program should process input using <code>StdIn.java</code> in the
following format.

</p><p>
The first line consists of a single integer <code>N</code>, the number
of records to read.
This is followed by a list of <code>N</code> records, one per line,
each consisting of two integers <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
separated by a space. The records do not appear in any specific order.

</p><p>
Your program should output the filtered, sorted records using
<code>StdOut.java</code>. Write
one record per line, <code>x</code> followed by <code>y</code> separated
by a space.

</p><p>
We have provided example input / output files in the archive linked at
the beginning of the handout. Use <code>filter1.txt</code>,
<code>filter2.txt</code>, and <code>filter3.txt</code> as input, and
<code>filter1out.txt</code>, <code>filter2out.txt</code>, and
<code>filter3out.txt</code> as output to test your program.

</p><h2>Part 2</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
Put the sorted input <code>N</code> records (unfiltered) into an array,
sorted by their x coordinates in increasing order. That array can be
viewed as representing a complete binary tree <code>T</code>. For every
node <code>v</code> of <code>T</code>, create an array <code>L[v]</code>
that contains the records in the subtree of <code>v</code> in
<code>T</code>, sorted according to their y coordinates. Note that this
creates multiple copies of a record (as many as ther record's ancestors
in <code>T</code>).

</p><p>
Hint: Create the <code>L[v]</code>'s in bottom-up order, so that you can
obtain the <code>L[v]</code> of a <code>v</code> whose children are
<code>u</code> and <code>w</code> by merging the already-computed
<code>L[u]</code> with the already-computed <code>L[w]</code> and with
<code>v</code>.

</p><p>
Use the tree <code>T</code> and the <code>L[v]</code> lists to efficiently
process queries of the type <code>Q(a,b)</code> that outputs the records
whose x coordinate is greater than <code>a</code> AND y coordinate is
greater than <code>b</code>. The records output from each query should be
sorted by their x coordinates in increasing order.

</p><p>
Performance for each such query should be
O((log <code>N</code>)<sup>2</sup> + <code>m</code> log <code>m</code>)
time where <code>m</code> is the number of output records.

</p><p>
Note: O(log <code>N</code> + <code>m</code> log <code>m</code>)
time performance is possible, but not required.

</p><h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
Create a class <code>Query.java</code> to perform the task described
above. Your program should process input using <code>StdIn.java</code>
in the following format.

</p><p>
The first part of the input is the same as for part 1: the first line
has a single integer <code>N</code>, followed by <code>N</code> records,
one record per line, each consisting of two integers <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> separated by a space. As in part 1, the records do not
appear in any specific order.
The line following the last record
contains a single integer <code>Q</code>, the number of queries to process.
This is followed by <code>Q</code> lines, one query per line, consisting
of two integers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> separated by a space.
Your program should process and output each query in the order it appears.

</p><p>
Your program should print the records output from each query to
<code>StdOut.java</code>. For each query, output <code>m</code> records,
one per line, each consisting of two integers <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> separated by a space, where <code>m</code> is the number of
records returned by that query. If a query returns zero records, output
a single line with the string "<code>none</code>" (without quotes).

</p><p>
As with part 1, we've included example input / output files in the
archive linked at the top of the handout. Use <code>query1.txt</code>,
<code>query2.txt</code>, and <code>query3.txt</code> as input, and
<code>query1out.txt</code>, <code>query2out.txt</code>, and
<code>query3out.txt</code> as output to test your program.

</p><p>
<b>Note:</b> since we require each query to have a specific complexity, your
code will be timed to ensure this requirement is met. Specific time limits
are yet to be determined.


</p><h2>Submission</h2>

<p>
Submit your solution on or before <b>Monday, October 16, 11:59pm</b>.
The submission procedure is the same as for previous projects. Inside your
working directory for this project on data
(e.g. <code>~/cs251/project3</code>), create a folder in which you will
include all source code used and libraries needed to compile and run your
code. Specifically, your submission must include the following files:

</p><ul>
<li><code>Filter.java</code>
</li><li><code>Query.java</code>
</li><li><code>readme.txt</code> (if needed)
</li></ul>

<p>
DO NOT use absolute paths in your files since they will become invalid
once submitted. Optionally, you can include a README file to let us know
about any known issues with your code (like errors, special conditions, etc).

</p><p>
After logging into <code>data.cs.purdue.edu</code>, please follow these
steps to submit your assignment:

</p><ul>
<li>Enter the working directory for this project
<pre>	%cd ~/cs251/project3
</pre>
</li><li>Make a directory named
<code>&lt;your_first_name&gt;_&lt;your_last_name&gt;</code> and copy
all the files needed to compile and run your code there.
</li><li>While still in the working directory of your project (e.g.
<code>~/cs251/project3</code>) execute the following turnin command:
<pre>	%turnin -c cs251 -p project3 &lt;your_first_name&gt;_&lt;your_last_name&gt;
</pre>
</li><li>Keep in mind that old submissions are overwritten with new ones whenever
you execute this command. You can verify the contents of your submission by
executing the following command:
<pre>	%turnin -v -c cs251 -p project3
</pre>
</li><li>Don't forget the <code>-v</code> flag here, as otherwise your submission
would be replaced with an empty one.
</li></ul>
