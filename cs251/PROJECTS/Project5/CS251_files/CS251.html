<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The input for this project is a connected undirected graph. Create
an adjacency lists representation of the graph, where every adjacency
list's contents are sorted by increasing order (this sortedness
requirement is for the purpose of obtaining the output we expect, so
that we can auto-grade it). Then do a depth-first search of that graph
starting from its highest-numbered vertex, during which you must
create a directed version of the input graph by assigning a direction
to each of its undirected edges. For tree edges the assigned direction
is from parent to child, for non-tree edges the assigned direction is
from descendent to ancestor. Finally, determine whether the created
directed graph is strongly connected or not. If the directed graph is
not strongly connected, compute the smallest number of directed edges
that would have to be added to the directed graph, in order to make
it strongly connected.

</p><h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>
Create a class <code>StronglyConnected.java</code> to perform the task
described above. Your program should process input using
<code>StdIn.java</code> in the format described on slide 16 of the
lecture notes 13 on undirected graphs (except that, for this project,
the graph will be connected). Specifically, the first line of input
consists of a single integer <code>V</code>, the number of vertices in
the graph. The second line is also a single integer <code>E</code>,
the number of edges in the graph. This is followed by <code>E</code>
edges, one edge per line, each consisting of two integers <code>u</code>
and <code>v</code>, separated by a space. The edges do not appear in
any specific order.

</p><p>
The desired output starts with a line consisting of a single integer
<code>K</code>, the minimum number of directed edges that would have
to be added to the directed graph in order to make it strongly connected
(hence if <code>K</code> is 0 then the graph is strongly connected without
adding any new directed edges to it).
This is followed by a listing
(one edge per line) of the resulting directed edges (each as an ordered
pair of vertices separated by a space), in the same order in which the
depth-first search assigned directions to them. Note that you list the
directed edges whether the directed graph is strongly connected or not.

</p><h2>Example</h2>
<p>
The input file contains:
</p><pre>	7
	8
	0 5
	4 3
	0 1
	6 4
	5 4
	0 2
	0 6
	5 3
</pre>

which represents the connected undirected graph below:

<p></p><center>
<img src="./graph.png">
</center>

<p>
The adjacency list of vertex 4 should then contain 3, 5, 6 in that
order. The depth-first search would start at vertex 6 and would visit
the graph's vertices in the following order:

</p><pre>	6, 0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4
</pre>

<p>
The resulting depth-first tree would have the following tree edges
(listed as (parent, child) pairs):

</p><pre>	(6,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,5), (5,3), (3,4)
</pre>

<p>
It would have the following two non-tree edges (listed as
(descendent,ancestor) pairs):

</p><pre>	(4,5), (4,6)
</pre>

<p>
The order in which the depth-first search assigns the above directions
to the edges would be:

</p><pre>	(6,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,5), (5,3), (3,4), (4,5), (4,6)
</pre>

<p>
The desired output file for this example would then contain:

</p><pre>	2
	6 0
	0 1
	0 2
	0 5
	5 3
	3 4
	4 5
	4 6
</pre>

<p>
In the above output, <code>K</code> is 2 because a minimum of two
directed edges must be added to the directed graph in order to make
it strongly connected.
(It is entirely coincidental that the tree edges appeared first. In
general you could have some non-tree edges appear before some tree
edges.)

above.

</p><h2>Submission</h2>

<p>
Submit your solution on or before <b>Monday, November 20, 11:59pm</b>.
The submission procedure is the same as for previous projects. Inside your
working directory for this project on data
(e.g. <code>~/cs251/project5</code>), create a folder in which you will
include all source code used and libraries needed to compile and run your
code. Specifically, your submission must include the following files:

</p><ul>
<li><code>StronglyConnected.java</code>
</li><li><code>readme.txt</code> (if needed)
</li></ul>

<p>
DO NOT use absolute paths in your files since they will become invalid
once submitted. Optionally, you can include a README file to let us know
about any known issues with your code (like errors, special conditions, etc).

</p><p>
After logging into <code>data.cs.purdue.edu</code>, please follow these
steps to submit your assignment:

</p><ul>
<li>Enter the working directory for this project
<pre>	%cd ~/cs251/project5
</pre>
</li><li>Make a directory named
<code>&lt;your_first_name&gt;_&lt;your_last_name&gt;</code> and copy
all the files needed to compile and run your code there.
</li><li>While still in the working directory of your project (e.g.
<code>~/cs251/project5</code>) execute the following turnin command:
<pre>	%turnin -c cs251 -p project5 &lt;your_first_name&gt;_&lt;your_last_name&gt;
</pre>
</li><li>Keep in mind that old submissions are overwritten with new ones whenever
you execute this command. You can verify the contents of your submission by
executing the following command:
<pre>	%turnin -v -c cs251 -p project5
</pre>
</li><li>Don't forget the <code>-v</code> flag here, as otherwise your submission
would be replaced with an empty one.
</li></ul>
